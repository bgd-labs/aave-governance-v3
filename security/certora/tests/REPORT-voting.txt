voting_and_tally.spec
=====================

Questions/Comments:
------------------
1. In most of the confs we have loop_iter==1. Is it correct ?
2. When running the tests:
   - power_summary.conf has several failures (including sanity fails)
   - misc.conf has several failures and timeouts
   - proposal_states.conf has one sanity failure.
3. I checked the mutants against:
   - legality.conf
   - proposal_config.conf
   - proposal_states.conf
   - voting_and_tally.conf


Mutations:
---------
1.  UNDETECTED
Changed file: VotingMachineWithProofs.sol ==> VotingMachineWithProofs-1.sol
The change: VotingMachineWithProofs.sol:88:
   orig:
    return _bridgedVotes[voter][proposalId];
   mutant:
    return _bridgedVotes[voter][proposalId+1];

Suggestion for rules that can catch it:


2. DETECTED (by sanity rule)

The change: VotingMachineWithProofs.sol:197:
